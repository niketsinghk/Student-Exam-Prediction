Project Objective:
To build a machine learning model that can predict student performance using historical data, thereby enhancing academic support and reducing dropout rates.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing
Cleaned and transformed student data, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling inputs.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized patterns and correlations between study time, parental education, previous scores, and final exam results.

Model Training
Implemented and evaluated multiple ML algorithms including:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Model Evaluation
Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to compare model performance.

Prediction Output
Given new student data (e.g., study time, test scores, family background), the model predicts whether the student is likely to pass or fail.
